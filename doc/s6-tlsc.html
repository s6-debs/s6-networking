<h1> The <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>s6-tlsc</tt> is a program that establishes a TLS or SSL
client connection over an existing TCP connection, then spawns
an application. It is meant to make network communications
secure even for applications that do not natively support
TLS/SSL.
</p>

<p>
 <a href="index.html">s6-networking</a> does not include
cryptographic software. All the crypto used in <tt>s6-tlsc</tt>
is provided by the chosen SSL backend:
<a href="https://bearssl.org/">BearSSL</a> or
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a>, depending on
the options given when configuring <tt>s6-networking</tt>.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-tlsc [ -S | -s ] [ -Y | -y ] [ -Z | -z ] [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -K kimeout ] [ -k <em>servername</em> ] [ -6 <em>rfd</em> ] [ -7 <em>wfd</em> ] [ -- ] <em>prog...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-tlsc expects to have an open TCP connection it
can talk to on its (by default) descriptors 6 (for reading)
and 7 (for writing). </li>
 <li> It spawns <em>prog...</em> as a child process,
interposing itself between it and the network. </li>
 <li> It initiates a TLS/SSL handshake over the
network connection, expecting a TLS/SSL server on the other
side. </li>
 <li> It manages the encryption/decryption of all the
messages between <em>prog</em> and the server.
<em>prog</em> speaks plaintext, but only ciphertext is sent
on the network. </li>
 <li> When <em>prog</em> exits, <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> exits.
</ul>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> 96: error while configuring the TLS/SSL context - for instance, invalid trust anchor set. </li>
 <li> 97: error while setting up the TLS/SSL client engine. </li>
 <li> 98: TLS/SSL error while running the engine. </li>
 <li> 100: wrong usage. </li>
 <li> 111: system call failed. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 If the TLS/SSL connection closes cleanly, <tt>s6-tlsc</tt>
waits for <em>prog</em> to exit, then exits with an
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/execline/exitcodes.html">approximation</a>
of <em>prog</em>'s exit code.
</p>

<h2> Protocol version and parameters </h2>

<p>
 During the TLS/SSL handshake, <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> tries
every version of the protocol that is supported by the
backend, with all supported algorithms and cipher suites;
the backend normally ensures that the most secure combination
is tried first, with slow degradation until the client and
the server agree.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> For BearSSL, this means use of the
<a href="https://bearssl.org/apidoc/bearssl__ssl_8h.html#aa386dd0b03a0123760bf63df5a41c1e0">br_ssl_client_init_full()</a>
function. The supported protocol versions are described
<a href="https://bearssl.org/support.html#supported-versions">here</a>. </li>
 <li> For LibreSSL, this means use of the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man3/tls_config_set_protocols.3">tls_config_set_protocols(TLS_PROTOCOLS_ALL)</a>
call. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 As a client, it is better for <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> to adapt to as many servers
as possible, that's why it adopts a liberal approach to protocol
versions.
</p>

<h2> Environment variables </h2>

<h3> Read </h3>

<p>
 <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> expects to have one of the
<tt>CADIR</tt> or <tt>CAFILE</tt> environment variables set.
It will refuse to run if both are unset. If both are set,
<tt>CADIR</tt> has priority. The value of that variable is:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> for <tt>CADIR</tt>: a directory where trust anchors
(i.e. root or intermediate CA certificates) can be found,
one per file, DER- or PEM-encoded. </li>
 <li> for <tt>CAFILE</tt>: a file containing the whole set
of trust anchors, PEM-encoded. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 If you are using client certificates, s6-tlsc also reads
two more environment variables: <tt>KEYFILE</tt> contains
the path to a file containing the private key, DER- or
PEM-encoded; and <tt>CERTFILE</tt> contains the path to
a file containing the client certificate, DER- or
PEM-encoded.
</p>

<p>
 If <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> is run as root, it can also read two
other environment variables, <tt>TLS_UID</tt> and <tt>TLS_GID</tt>,
which contain a numeric uid and a numeric gid; <tt>s6-tlsc</tt>
then drops its root privileges to this uid/gid after spawning
<em>prog...</em>. This ensures that the TLS/engine and the
application run with different privileges. Note that <em>prog...</em>
should drop its own root privileges by its own means: the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-applyuidgid.html">s6-applyuidgid</a>
program is a way of doing it.
</p>

<h3> Written </h3>

<p>
 Unless the <tt>-Z</tt> option has been given to
<tt>s6-tlsc</tt>, <em>prog...</em> is run with all the
TLS/SSL variables <em>unset</em>: CADIR, CAFILE,
KEYFILE, CERTFILE, TLS_UID and TLS_GID. The goal is
for <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> to be, by default, as invisible
as possible.
</p>

<h2> Server name determination for SNI </h2>

<p>
 The <tt>-k <em>servername</em></tt> option is important to
<tt>s6-tlsc</tt>: it tells it to send <em>servername</em>
as the name to require a certificate for.
Not setting this option allows <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> to
proceed without SNI,
<strong>which may be a security risk.</strong>
</p>

<p>
 The <a href="s6-tlsclient.html">s6-tlsclient</a> program can
automatically craft a <tt>-k</tt> option for <tt>s6-tlsc</tt>
if the <em>host</em> argument that is given to it is a
host name. But if you're invoking <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> directly,
do not forget to give it this option.
</p>

<h2> SSL close handling </h2>

<p>
 If <em>prog</em> initiates the end of the session by sending
EOF, there are two ways for the TLS/SSL layer to handle it.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> It can send a <tt>close_notify</tt> alert, and wait for
an acknowledgement from the peer, at which point the connection
is closed. The advantage of this setup is that it is secure
even when the application protocol is not auto-terminated, i.e.
when it does not know when its data stops. Old protocols such
as HTTP-0.9 are in this case. The drawback of this setup is
that it breaks full-duplex: once a peer has sent the
<tt>close_notify</tt>, it must discard all the incoming
records that are not a <tt>close_notify</tt> from the
other peer. So if a client sends EOF while it is still
receiving data from the server, the connection closes
immediately and the data can be truncated. </li>
 <li> It can simply transmit the EOF, shutting down
half the TCP connection, and wait for the EOF back.
The advantage of this setup is that it maintains
full-duplex: a client can send EOF after its initial
request, and still receive a complete answer from the
server. The drawback is that it is insecure when the application
protocol is not auto-terminated. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Nowadays (2017), most protocols are auto-terminated, so
it is not dangerous anymore to use EOF tranmission, and that
is the default for <tt>s6-tlsc</tt>. Nevertheless, by
using the <tt>-S</tt> option, you can
force it to use the <tt>close_notify</tt> method if your
application requires it to be secure.
</p>

<h2> <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-v&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em></tt>&nbsp;: Be more or less
verbose. Default for <em>verbosity</em> is 1. 0 is quiet, 2 is
verbose, more than 2 is debug output. This option currently has
no effect. </li>
 <li> <tt>-Z</tt>&nbsp;: do not clean the environment of
<tt>s6-tlsc</tt>-related variables before spawning <em>prog...</em>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-z</tt>&nbsp;: clean the environment of
<tt>s6-tlsc</tt>-related variables before spawning <em>prog...</em>.
This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-S</tt>&nbsp;: send a <tt>close_notify</tt> alert
and break the connection when <em>prog</em> sends EOF. </li>
 <li> <tt>-s</tt>&nbsp;: transmit EOF by half-closing the TCP
connection without using <tt>close_notify</tt>. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-Y</tt>&nbsp;: Do not send a client certificate. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-y</tt>&nbsp;: Send a client certificate. </li>
 <li> <tt>-k&nbsp;<em>servername</em></tt>&nbsp;: use Server Name
Indication, and send <em>servername</em>. The default is not to
use SNI, which may be a security risk. </li>
 <li> <tt>-K&nbsp;<em>kimeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: close the connection
if <em>kimeout</em> milliseconds elapse without any data being
received from either side. The default is 0, which means
infinite timeout (never kill the connection). </li>
 <li> <tt>-6&nbsp;<em>rfd</em></tt>&nbsp;: expect an open file
descriptor numbered <em>rfd</em> to read network (ciphertext)
data from. Make sure <em>prog</em> also reads its data
from its own fd <em>rfd</em>. Default is 6. </li>
 <li> <tt>-7&nbsp;<em>wfd</em></tt>&nbsp;: expect an open file
descriptor numbered <em>wfd</em> to write network (ciphertext)
data to. Make sure <em>prog</em> also writes its data to
its own fd <em>wfd</em>. Default is 7. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> The goal of the <tt>s6-tlsc</tt> interface (and its
server-side companion <a href="s6-tlsd.html">s6-tlsd</a>) is to
make it so that if you have a client, run by the command line
<tt>client...</tt> that speaks a cleartext protocol to a server
run by the command line <tt>server...</tt>, then if the server
has the proper private key and certificate, and the client has
the proper list of trust anchors, you can just change the
client command line to <tt>s6-tlsc client...</tt> and the
server command line to <tt>s6-tlsd server...</tt>
without changing the client or the server themselves, and the
communication between them will be secure. </li>
</ul>
